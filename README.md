How would you implement a thread-safe Singleton in Java without using synchronized?
(Hint: Think of Bill Pugh Singleton pattern using static inner classes.)
When would you prefer Strategy Pattern over State Pattern, given that both use composition over inheritance?
(Hint: Consider mutability and behavioral context switching.)
Explain how the Decorator pattern can be used to add functionality to objects at runtime. How is it different from subclassing? Provide a real-world example.

Can you combine Factory and Singleton patterns? How would you implement this, and in what scenarios would it be useful?

Compare Proxy and Decorator patterns. Both involve wrapping objectsâ€”how do their intents and use cases differ?

How would you design a rate limiter for an API gateway in a distributed microservices architecture?

(Hint: Think of token bucket, leaky bucket, Redis-based counters.)
